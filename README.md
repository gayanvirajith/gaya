### Sidebar navigation configurations

As jekyll supports data files, **Gaya** theme uses `YAML` [data file][df] to load sidebar navigation items. You could find the `main-nav.yaml` data file under `_data/` directory. You could add any number of menu items by modifying `main-nav.yaml`. 

An example of `main-nav.yaml`:

```
- title: "About me" # Title/Caption of the menu item
  href: "/about" # the page where it pointed
- title: "Blog Archive"
  href: "/archive"
```

At some point you want to link an external URL, in that case you could edit the `_includes/sidebar.html` file. See the following example:

```
<nav class="sidebar-nav">
   <a class="sidebar-nav-item" 
      href="http://www.example.com"
      target="_blank">
      Example site
    </a>
</nav>
```
